## My process

I just write the code what comes to my mind while following the given output sample. I tried to copy the interface which I think I did. I also make the media screen three for responsiveness in every angle.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Website-first workflow and the mobile. I also include the tablet's size devices.

### What I learned

Just like writing novels, go write even if its a trash. When you finish it, do the editing, style it and make it more engaging. As a beginner, I don't memorize the codes but by experimenting, I did it and the same time I learned.

## Link Used

I use some tool to identify what font has been used.
